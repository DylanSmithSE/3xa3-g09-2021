# Kingme 3XA3-G09-2021

Kingme is a checkers application that I created for my Software Project Management course (3XA3), along with Thaneegan and Ardhendu. We reimplemented an open source project by [Codeofcarsen](https://github.com/codeofcarson/Checkers) (see documentation for design decisions with further details).

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

```python
cd BlankProjectTemplate/src
python main.py
or
