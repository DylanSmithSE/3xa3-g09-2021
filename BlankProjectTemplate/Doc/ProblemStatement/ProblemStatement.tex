\section{What is the problem?}
Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, people are now more than ever trying to find sources of entertainment. Computer games popularity has risen significantly and people from all ages are hoping on to computer or mobile to pass their time as everyone is stuck at home. New computer games with great graphics are releasing but not everyone is able to afford expensive game players such as xbox or playstation. In addition, the older generation is not quite familiar or accustomed  with the new technology. Hence, classic games such as checkers will be preferred by adults. Additionally, board games have become a popular solution for passing the time however, they can be difficult to purchase with all the business closures and can be costly, not to mention they do not help the single households who do not have anyone to play with.

\section{Why is this an important problem?}
The current pandemic has been hard on everyone. Providing people, single households and families alike, with a fun way to pass the time is a great way to help everyone through these difficult times. Checkers allows players to improve their strategic and problem solving skills, unlike many other games which are simply played to pass time and do not benefit the player mentally. Players will benefit greatly from exercising their mind in a fun way via checkers. The game should be robust, easy to use, and accessible to all people that decide to play the game, as it is important that the players feel comfortable on the app.

\section{What is the context of the problem?}
Our solution is to develop a checkers computer game. Checkers is a game that is great for all ages, it is easy to learn and lots of fun to play. Our checkers game will have two options, the first being to play against another person, and the second to play against a computer. This will make our checkers game accessible to both families and single households. We hope this will provide everyone with a fun way to pass the time. The stakeholders for this are the developers, players, and the 3XA3 instructors. The developers will include the members of our group 09 as we will be involved in creating, maintaining and documenting the project. The players will include people of all ages who are interested \& are capable of playing checkers. The 3XA3 instructors include the professor and the TAs who will be providing continuous feedback throughout the project lifecycle.
